# Monte_Carlo_Simulation

## About  

This project uses Monte-Carlo Simulations to evaluate numerically bit and symbol error rates for digital communication systems operating in the Additive White Gaussian 
Noise Channel (AWGN). The modulation schemes that are supported are BPSK, OOK, QPSK and 16-QAM.

## How to run

Simply call modulation scheme of choice, for example BPSK.m. Please note simulation could take time especially after exceeding 100,000 samples

## The simulation block diagram is shown below:
